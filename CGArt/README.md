# CGArt

This was for an elements of art project, where we had to make a disc with segments for each element.

I decided to write programs for each element that would create the sections for me.

## Requirements

- `pygame`
- `noise`

## Usage

Each script creates one segment.

## Filestructure

`output/` is where most of the scripts output things.
`output/final/` is where I put the outputs I liked the most
`FINAL Side1.png` is the final composition of the segments
